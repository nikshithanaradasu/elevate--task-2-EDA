# 📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🎯 Objective
To understand the structure, trends, and relationships in the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and data visualizations.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)

## 📁 Files Included
- `2nd task.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing the full EDA workflow
- `cleaned_titanic.csv` – Cleaned dataset from Task 1 (optional but used here)
- `README.md` – This documentation file

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Imported necessary libraries
2. Loaded cleaned Titanic dataset
3. Generated summary statistics (mean, median, std, nulls)
4. Created histograms and boxplots for numeric features
5. Visualized feature relationships using correlation matrix and pairplot
6. Compared survival by sex and class
7. Listed observations and insights from EDA

## 💡 Key Insights
- 🚺 **Females** had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- 🛏️ **1st class passengers** had better survival odds compared to 2nd/3rd class.
- 📉 **Fare** and **Age** had some skewness and outliers.
- 🧠 **'Sex'** and **'Pclass'** appear to be strong predictors for survival.

## ✅ Status
Task 2 completed successfully and submitted as part of the Elevate Labs AI/ML Internship.
